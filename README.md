# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
To create database, tables and import files into the database
To transform and analyze tables in the database using SQL
To generate ERD of the tables in the database
## Process
Create a database using PgAdmin 4
Create tables and their corresponding data types.
Assigning unique keys and foreign keys
Import the .csv files and ensuring the delimitter is , and column head is activated
Cleaned the data by ensuring Null values are taken care off by equating to 0
Clean the data by dividing the unit price by 1000000
Clean the data by removing duplicates
Analyzed data using the given dataset

## Results
I discovered that the United states has the highest level with (13,154). Followed by Israel(602) and Australia(358) The City that has the highest level of transaction is San Francisco(1,564) in the United States, followed by Sunnyvale(992) and Atlanta(854)

The country with the top selling product is United States The city with the top selling product is Mountain View

The United States generated more revenue than any other country.

## Challenges 
Assigning the data types to fit the data coming from the csv file
Not employing all process to cleaning data
Developing a high level QA process


## Future Goals
Properly clean the dataset
Consult resources on time and quickly
Read up more functions and their uses.
Generate the full ERD of the database
Develop more QA process
